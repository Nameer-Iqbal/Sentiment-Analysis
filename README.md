# Sentiment-Analysis
our study demonstrates the viability of employing TextBlob for Aspect-Based
Sentiment Analysis (ABSA). Through a systematic methodology encompassing preprocessing,
aspect extraction, and sentiment analysis, we effectively parsed textual data to identify key
aspects and associated sentiments. Notably, TextBlob's rule-based approach proved adept at
handling straightforward text with discernible sentiment expressions, yielding valuable insights
into opinions and attitudes.
